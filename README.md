# CollabCar

CollabCar provides an interactive platform for people from the same institution to carpool when going to the same place/event. The application allows users to register themselves as the host or "carpool-ers" and accordingly create a post about the upcoming event and form groups with fellow users from the same community. Subsequently, users are enabled to join a "group" to get to the said event, in a safe and fun way! CollabCar gets members of the same institution to get to a place safely and make friends along the ride!

This repository contains code developed for Hack GT 8 at the Georgia Institute of Technology by Shivom Dhamija, Samyak Jain, Karthik Kundurthy and Arnav Mardia.
